This tutorial serves as an introduction to using machine learning classification algorithms with real-world data. The "1R" or "One Rule" algorithm is the simplest of all classification algorithms and works by finding a single feature in the data that has the best predictive power and using that as its rule to predict the dependent variable on novel data. 

Running formatMushroomData.R will pull the data from the UCI Machine Learning repository, format it to have more readable data, and export the data as "mushroom_data.csv", which you will need in order to run the 1R_tutorial.R script. The "mushroom_data.csv" file is provided here.
